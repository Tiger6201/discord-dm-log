# discord-dm-log
I'm fed up with people deleting their messages in dm so I made this bot to log all the messages you receive.<br/>
I'm using Discord.js@11.6.1 so you can use your user account and not a bot account token
# How to install
Video how to get your token : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD5houIO6Zg<br/>
